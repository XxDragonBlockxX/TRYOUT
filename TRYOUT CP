Welcome to your tryout. I am your host [XxDragonBlockxX] And you shall address me as Sir!

You shall not speak unless permitted by myself.

There will be a strike system in place. If you receive three strikes at any point, you will be removed from my tryout.

Am I understood?

Now, I will need to test your safe chat. 

Say "DRAUL".
