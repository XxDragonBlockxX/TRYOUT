Remember the instructor who enlisted you into the British Army? Wanna fill their boots? Then ETS is calling for you at the Parade Deck! We only select the best of the best. You must be on PC.

Welcome to your tryout. I am your host [XxDragonBlockxX] And you shall address me as Sir!

You shall not speak unless permitted by myself.

There will be a strike system in place. If you receive three strikes at any point, you will be removed from my tryout.

Am I understood?

First, I need all of you to say " DRAUL " .

Now, I will go ahead and demonstrate the drill commands since you will have to perform them later.

Do not copy me while I perform them, pay close attention instead.

LEFT, TURN - 90 DEGREE TURN TO YOUR LEFT!

RIGHT, TURN - 90 DEGREE TURN TO YOUR RIGHT!

ABOUT, TURN - 180 DEGREE TO FACE THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM YOUR POSITION!

CENTRE, TURN - TURN TO FACE THE DIRECTION OF THE HOST!

LEFT, INCLINE - 45 DEGREE TURN TO YOUR LEFT!

RIGHT, INCLINE - 45 DEGREE TURN TO YOUR RIGHT!

These are drill commands, now we will move on to elims.

I will say a random drill commmand I just showed you and your job will be to only do the commands that are grammarly correct.

If you do a command incorrectly, you will receive a strike.

Is everyone in the main BA discoard server and verified?

Now, when I come up to you, I want you to do !bgcheck in bot commands to see if you are an clear account.

Now, I will check if you received blacklist from the division.
